# Treehouse-Node-Project

A node.js command line application that scrapes the profile webpages for given Treehouse usernames for their total badges and points in a given area and displays them on the console log.

The first command line argument is the area to return points from, and the rest are usernames.

E.g "node app.js HTML chalkers davemcfarland"
